# ACO-Metro-Mexico-City

ACO-Metro-Mexico-City is a tool designed to trace and compute the optimal route for navigating the Mexico City metro system. It leverages the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, a population-based metaheuristic, to find the most efficient paths. This tool is equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI) for user-friendly interactions.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to assist users in planning and navigating the extensive metro system in Mexico City. By implementing the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, the tool calculates the most efficient route between stations, considering factors like distance, time, and transfers. The GUI provides an intuitive platform for users to input their starting and destination stations, view the optimal route, and gain insights into the journey.

## Features

- **Ant Colony Optimization**: Utilizes the ACO algorithm to find optimal metro routes.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a user-friendly experience for input and output.
- **Route Visualization**: Displays the recommended path with necessary details.
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Offers insights into time, distance, and transfer counts for selected routes.
